# Repokarma

This project aims to be a nice and fluffy dashboard / browser to get executive
summaries + some nice stats out of your repos. I will initially do this for
mercurial. This is simply because for day-to-day work, that's where the interesting stuff happens. Plus of course I have access to a nice set of test data from a real world use scenario.

Hosting this thing on github is a bit oxymoronic, I admit.
